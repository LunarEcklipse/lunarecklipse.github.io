                        <p class="project--description"><span class="title--deco">Vamplify</span> is a turn-based roguelike video game built in Unity Engine in two months for the Advanced Game Design Studio class at the University of Lethbridge. The player plays as a vampire who enters a manor with the goal of achieving as much power as possible. This power is achieved by the grafting of limbs of fallen opponents onto one's body.</p>
                        <p class="project--description">For this project, I was responsible for gameplay design and programming. The turn system was written entirely custom by myself, along with the attack system, enemy AI, as well as the system for randomly generated treasure. These treasures were able to accept a series of random modifiers which made them stronger or weaker. It also featured a system for calculating attacks on a grid-based system which was created entirely custom, allowing the player's attacks to hit different arrays of tiles, which could even be blocked by obstacles in the environment.</p>

                        <p class="project--description"><span class="title--deco">Undersea</span> is a video created for the Nikka Yuko Japanese Gardens projection dome in Lethbridge, Alberta for the Emerging Video Technology class at the University of Lethbridge. The project was meant to invoke the feeling of slowly sinking into tranquil waters.</p>
                        <p class="project--description">The project was created primarily through Blender, with additional effects added via Adobe After Effects. To achieve the effect of slowly sinking into the water, the animation took place underneath a surface using Blender's Ocean modifier to create the wave-like distortions, as well as a cube with a volumetric shader to emulate the water. The fish themselves were animated using keyframes and Blender's Displacement modifier in combination with a noise texture. Finally, in order to simulate the curvature of the projection dome, a fisheye lens was simulated. Once this was all done, the entire animation was rendered using Blender's Cycles rendering engine.</p>
                        <p class="project--description">With the animation created, I then imported the animation into Adobe After Effects. Using After Effects' built-in particle and wave simulation systems, I created the splash effect, as well as the bubbles that occur any time the viewer is sinking. After Effects allowed me to simulate these effects in three-dimensional space as well as use keyframes to modulate the intensity as well as the color of these effects over the course of the animation. Finally, the project was brought together by adding royalty-free audio found from across the internet using sources like Pixabay and Freesound, with some added audio distortion to truly emulate the experience of being underwater.</p>

                        <p class="project--description"><span class="title--deco">4096</span> is a puzzle video game created in five days for the Advanced Game Design Studio class at the University of Lethbridge. Created in a Game Jam style setting, it was inspired by a prompt, for which we were given the number "4096".</p>
                        <p class="project--description">As the cubic root of 4096 is 16, we created a pair of "shapes" that could be fit inside of a 16x16x16 cube for a total of 4096 blocks. The player can click on these blocks to excavate them, eventually revealing a final shape. 4096 in particular however was important as it was the first time I spent a significant amount of effort on game optimization. As spawning 4096 cubes all at once resulted in poor performance, I instead implemented a "voxel" approach, where you use the positional data of each element to dynamically create 3D geometry the player can interact with. This massively improved performance while also helping me learn about a new technique for displaying computer graphics.</p>

                        <p class="project--description"><span class="title--deco">Purrfect Pasta</span> is a puzzle video game created in five days for the Advanced Game Design Studio class at the University of Lethbridge. Created in a Game Jam style setting, it was inspired by a prompt, for which we were given "Food".</p>
                        <p class="project--description">We decided to create a sort of Diner Dash style experience for the purposes of this project where the player plays as a cat serving various cat-themed pastas. Customers come into the restaurant at regular intervals and sit at tables, where they will request a pasta with a certain noodle, sauce, and topping. The player must mix and match their plate to meet the demands of these customers to serve them correctly.</p>

                    <p class="project--description"><span class="title--deco">Verity Falls</span> is a visual novel video game created for the Game Design: Theory and Practice class at the University of Lethbridge using the Unity game engine. It features a cast of characters whose car is sabotaged as they arrive in town as they try to figure out who wants to keep them there and why.</p>
                    <p class="project--description">Verity Falls features 3D environments that the player can explore and interact with, as well as a cast of characters they can speak to. The dialogue system was made entirely from scratch, and characters can move around and change their dialogue in response to events, player progression, or even what character the player is currently playing as.</p>

                    <p class="project--description"><span class="title--deco">Crossing Wires</span> was an interactive installation created for the Interaction Design course at the University of Lethbridge that explored how one's concept of time is a function of our memories, and how as those memories fade, so can our ability to understand it.</p>
                    <p class="project--description">The project made use of two computers running the Processing programming language as well as two Arduino devices. The Arduino devices could communicate with one another through morse code, which the two computers using Processing could then process the data from. To facilitate this, users were prompted to answer questions on one computer through a custom interface implemented in Processing, which would then be transmitted to the other via Arduino. However, there were many intentional flaws left in the method of data transmission to introduce variable amounts of disruption into the overall output, which led to answers provided to one computer being skewed when received by the other. This emulated the process of how details can be lost as memory ages, with recall failing during the passage of time.</p>
                    <p class="project--description">All of the code for the Morse Code translation and communication was designed from scratch and implemented using C++, and the UIs for both the older and newer version of Windows were recreated in Processing to help give the user interface a familiar feel.</p>
